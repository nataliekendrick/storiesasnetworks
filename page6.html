I handed back the sheet of paper in silence. Albert went on:

<br>
"Before I discovered this letter, I kept asking myself how a book could be infinite. I
could not imagine any other than a cyclic volume, circular. A volume whose last page
would be the same as the first and so have the possibility of continuing indefinitely. I
recalled, too, the night in the middle of The Thousand and One Nights when Queen
Scheherezade, through a magical mistake on the part of her copyist, started to tell
the story of The Thousand and One Nights, with the risk of again arriving at the
night upon which she will relate it, and thus on to infinity. <span class="fillrect"> I also imagined a Platonic hereditary work, passed on from father to son, to which each individual would add a new chapter or correct, with pious care, the work of his elders.</span>
<br>
<br>
"These conjectures gave me amusement, but none seemed to have the remotest
<span class="fillrect">application to the contradictory chapters of Ts'ui Pen. </span> At this point, I was sent from Oxford the manuscript you have just seen.

<br>
<br>
"Naturally, my attention was caught by the sentence, 'I leave to various future times,
but not to all, my garden of forking paths: I had no sooner read this, than I understood.<span class="fillrect"> The Garden of Forking Paths was the chaotic novel itself.</span> The phrase 'to various future imes, but not to all' suggested the image of bifurcating in time, not in space. Rereading the whole work confirmed this theory. In all fiction, <span class="fillrect">when a man is faced with alternatives he chooses one at the expense of the others.</span> In the almost unfathomable <span class="fillrect">Ts'ui Pen, he chooses - simultaneously - all of them. He thus creates various futures, various times which start others that will in their turn branch out and bifurcate in other times.</span> This is the cause of the contradictions in the novel.

<br>
"<span class="fillrect">Fang, let us say, has a secret.</span> A stranger knocks at his door. <span class="fillrect">Fang makes up his mind to kill him.</span> Naturally there are various possible outcomes. <span class="fillrect">Fang can kill the intruder, the intruder can kill Fang, both can be saved, both can die and so on and so on.</span> In Ts'ui Pen's work, all the possible solutions occur, each one being the point of departure for other bifurcations. Sometimes the pathways of this labyrinth converge. <span class="fillrect">For example, you come to this house; but in other possible pasts you are my enemy; in others my friend.</span>

"If you will put up with my atrocious pronunciation, I would like to read you a few
pages of your ancestor's work."

His countenance, in the bright circle of lamplight, was certainly that of an ancient, but
it shone with something unyielding, even immortal.
<br>
<br>
With slow precision, he read two versions of the same epic chapter. <span class="fillrect">In the first, an army marches into battle over a desolate mountain pass. The bleak and somber
aspect of the rocky landscape made the soldiers feel that life itself was of little value,
and so they won the battle easily. In the second, the same army passes through a
palace where a banquet is in progress. The splendor of the feast remained a memory
throughout the glorious battle, and so victory followed.</span>
<br>
<br>
With proper veneration I listened to these old tales, although perhaps with less
admiration for them in themselves than for the fact that they had been thought out
by one of my own blood, <span class="fillrect">and that a man of a distant empire had given them back to
