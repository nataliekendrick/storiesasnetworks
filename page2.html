arid Berlin office, </span> leafed infinitely through newspapers, looking in vain for news from us. I said aloud,<span class="fillrect"> "I must flee."</span>

<br>
<br>

I sat up on the bed, in senseless and perfect silence, as if Madden was already peering at me. Something - perhaps merely a desire to prove my total penury to myself - made me empty out my pockets. I found just what I knew I was going to find. <span class="fillrect">The American watch, the nickel-plated chain and the square coin, the key ring with the useless but compromising keys to Runeberg's office, the notebook, a letter which I decided to destroy at once (and which I did not destroy), a five shilling piece, two single shillings and some pennies, a red and blue pencil, a handkerchief - and a revolver with a single bullet. </span> Absurdly I held it and weighed it in my hand, to give myself courage. Vaguely I thought that a pistol shot can be heard for a great distance.

<br>
<br>

In ten minutes I had developed my plan. The telephone directory gave me the name
of the one person capable of passing on the information. <span class="fillrect">He lived in a suburb of
Fenton, </span> less than half an hour away by train.

<br>
<br>

I am a timorous man. I can say it now, now that I have brought my incredibly risky
plan to an end. It was not easy to bring about, and <span class="fillrect">I know that its execution was
terrible. I did not do it for Germany </span> - no! Such a <span class="fillrect">barbarous country is of no
importance to me, particularly since it had degraded me by making me become a spy. </span>
Furthermore, I knew an Englishman - a modest man - who, for me, is as great as
Goethe. I did not speak with him for more than an hour, but during that time, <span class="fillrect">he was Goethe.</span>

<br>
<br>

<span class="fillrect">I carried out my plan </span> because I felt the Chief had some fear of those of my race, of
those uncountable forebears whose culmination lies in me. I wished to prove to him
that a yellow man could save his armies. <span class="fillrect">Besides, I had to escape the Captain. </span> His
hands and voice could, at any moment, knock and beckon at my door.

<br>
<br>

Silently, I dressed, took leave of myself in the mirror, went down the stairs, sneaked
a look at the quiet street, and went out. The station was not far from my house, but
I thought it more prudent to take a cab. I told myself that I thus ran less chance of
being recognized. The truth is that, in the deserted street, I felt infinitely visible and
vulnerable. I recall that I told the driver to stop short of the main entrance. I got out
with a painful and deliberate slowness.

<br>
<br>

<span class="fillrect">I was going to the village of Ashgrove,</span> but took a ticket for a station further on. The
train would leave in a few minutes, at eight-fifty. I hurried, for the next would not go
until half past nine. There was almost no one on the platform. I walked through the
carriages.<span class="fillrect"> I remember some farmers, a woman dressed in mourning, a youth deep in
Tacitus' Annals and a wounded, happy soldier.</span>

<br>
<br>

At last the train pulled out. A man I recognized ran furiously, but vainly, the length of the platform. <span class="fillrect">It was Captain Richard Madden. </span> Shattered, trembling, I huddled in the distant corner of the seat, as far as possible from the fearful window.

<br>
<br>

From utter terror I passed into a state of almost abject happiness.<span class="fillrect"> I told myself that the duel had already started and that I had won the first encounter by besting my adversary in his first attack - even if it was only for forty minutes - by an accident of fate. </span> I argued that so small a victory prefigured a total victory. I argued that it was
