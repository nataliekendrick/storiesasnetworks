<span class="fillrect">The road kept descending and branching off, through meadows misty in the twilight. </span> A high-pitched and almost syllabic music kept coming and going, moving with the breeze, blurred by the leaves and by distance.

<br>

I thought that a man might be an enemy of other men, of the differing moments of
other men, but never an enemy of a country: not of fireflies, words, gardens,
streams, or the West wind.

<br>
<br>

Meditating thus <span class="fillrect">I arrived at a high, rusty iron gate. </span> Through the railings I could see an
avenue bordered with poplar trees and also a kind of summer house or pavilion.
Two things dawned on me at once, the first trivial and the second almost incredible:
the music came from the pavilion and that music was Chinese. That was why I had
accepted it fully, without paying it any attention. I do not remember whether there
was a bell, a push-button, or whether I attracted attention by clapping my hands. The
stuttering sparks of the music kept on.

<br>
<br>

But from the end of the avenue, from the main house, a lantern approached; a
lantern which alternately, from moment to moment, was crisscrossed or put out by
the trunks of the trees; a paper lantern shaped like a drum and colored like the
moon.<span class="fillrect"> A tall man carried it. I could not see his face for the light blinded me. </span>

<br>
<br>

He opened the gate and spoke slowly in my language.

<br>
<br>

<span class="fillrect">"I see that the worthy Hsi P'eng has troubled himself to see to relieving my solitude.
No doubt you want to see the garden?" </span>

<br>
<br>

Recognizing the name of one of our consuls, I replied, somewhat taken aback.

<br>
<br>

"The garden?"

<br>
<br>

<span class="fillrect">"The garden of forking paths."</span>

<br>
<br>

Something stirred in my memory and I said, with incomprehensible assurance:

<br>
<br>

<span class="fillrect">"The garden of my ancestor, Ts'ui Pen."</span>

<br>
<br>

"Your ancestor? Your illustrious ancestor? Come in."

<br>
<br>

The damp path zigzagged like those of my childhood. When we reached the house,
we went into a library filled with books from both East and West. I recognized some
large volumes bound in yellow silk-manuscripts of the Lost Encyclopedia which was
edited by the Third Emperor of the Luminous Dynasty. They had never been
printed. A phonograph record was spinning near a bronze phoenix. I remember also
a rose-glazed jar and yet another, older by many centuries, of that blue color which
our potters copied from the Persians . . .

<span class="fillrect">Stephen Albert was watching me with a smile on his face.</span> He was, as I have said, remarkably tall. His face was deeply lined and he had gray eyes and a gray beard. There was about him something of the priest, and something of the sailor. Later,<span class="fillrect"> he
