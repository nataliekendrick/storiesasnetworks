"In all of them," I enunciated, with a tremor in my voice. <span class="fillrect">"I deeply appreciate and am grateful to you for the restoration of Ts'ui Pen's garden."</span>

<br>
<br>
"Not in all," he murmured with a smile. <span class="fillrect">"Time is forever dividing itself toward innumerable futures and in one of them I am your enemy."</span>
<br>
<br>
Once again I sensed the pullulation of which I have already spoken. It seemed to me
that the dew-damp garden surrounding the house was infinitely saturated with
invisible people. <span class="fillrect">All were Albert and myself, secretive, busy and multiform in other dimensions of time. I lifted my eyes and the short nightmare disappeared. In the black and yellow garden there was only a single man, but this man was as strong as a
statue and this man was walking up the path and he was Captain Richard Madden.</span>
<br>
<br>
"The future exists now," I replied. <span class="fillrect"> "But I am your friend. Can I take another look at the letter?"</span>
<br>
<br>
Albert rose from his seat. He stood up tall as he opened the top drawer of the high
writing cabinet. For a moment his back was again turned to me. <span class="fillrect">I had the revolver ready. I fired with the utmost care: Albert fell without a murmur, at once. I swear
that his death was instantaneous, as if he had been struck by lightning.</span>

<br>
<br>

What remains is unreal and unimportant.<span class="fillrect"> Madden broke in and arrested me. I have been condemned to hang.</span> Abominably, I have yet triumphed! <span class="fillrect">The secret name of the city to be attacked got through to Berlin. Yesterday it was bombed.</span> I read the news in the same English newspapers which were trying to <span class="fillrect">solve the riddle of the murder of the learned Sinologist Stephen Albert by the unknown Yu Tsun. The Chief, however, had already solved this mystery.</span> He knew that my problem was to shout, <span class="fillrect">with my feeble voice, above the tumult of war, the name of the city called Albert, and that I had no other course open to me than to kill someone of that name.</span> He does not know, for no one can, of my infinite penitence and sickness of the heart.
