told me he had been a missionary in Tientsin before he "had aspired to become a Sinologist."</span>

<br>
<br>

We sat down, I upon a large, low divan, he with his back to the window and to a
large circular clock. I calculated that my pursuer, <span class="fillrect">Richard Madden, could not arrive in less than an hour. </span> My irrevocable decision could wait.

<br>
<br>

<span class="fillrect">"A strange destiny," said Stephen Albert, "that of Ts'ui Pen - Governor of his native province, </span> learned in astronomy, in astrology and tireless in the interpretation of the canonical books, a chess player, a famous poet and a calligrapher. <span class="fillrect">Yet he abandoned all to make a book and a labyrinth.</span> He gave up all the pleasures of oppression,
justice, of a well-stocked bed, of banquets, and even of erudition, and shut himself up
in the Pavilion of the Limpid Sun for thirteen years. At his death, his heirs found only
a mess of manuscripts. The family, as you doubtless know, wished to consign them
to the fire, but the executor of the estate - a Taoist or a Buddhist monk - insisted on
their publication."

<br>
<br>

<span class="fillrect">"Those of the blood of Ts'ui Pen," I replied, "still curse the memory of that monk. </span> Such a publication was madness. The book is a shapeless mass of contradictory rough drafts. I examined it once upon a time: <span class="fillrect">the hero dies in the third chapter, while in the fourth he is alive. As for that other enterprise of Ts'ui Pen . . . his
Labyrinth . . ."</span>

<br>
<br>

<span class="fillrect">"Here is the Labyrinth," Albert said, pointing to a tall, laquered writing cabinet.</span>

<br>
<br>
"An ivory labyrinth?" I exclaimed. "A tiny labyrinth indeed . . . !"
<br>
<br>
<span class="fillrect">"A symbolic labyrinth," he corrected me. "An invisible labyrinth of time. I, a barbarous Englishman, have been given the key to this transparent mystery. </span> After more than a hundred years most of the details are irrecoverable, lost beyond all
recall, but it isn't hard to image what must have happened. At one time,<span class="fillrect"> Ts'ui Pen must have said; 'I am going into seclusion to write a book,' and at another, 'I am
retiring to construct a maze.' Everyone assumed these were separate activities.</span> No
one realized that the book and the labyrinth were one and the same.<span class="fillrect"> The Pavilion of the Limpid Sun was set in the middle of an intricate garden. This may have suggested the idea of a physical maze.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="fillrect">"Ts'ui Pen died. In all the vast lands which once belonged to your family, no one could find the labyrinth.</span> The novel's confusion suggested that it was the labyrinth.
<br>
<br>
Two circumstances showed me the direct solution to the problem. <span class="fillrect">First, the curious legend that Ts'ui Pen had proposed to create an infinite maze, second, a fragment of
a letter which I discovered."</span>
<br>
<br>
Albert rose. For a few moments he turned his back to me. He opened the top
drawer in the high black and gilded writing cabinet. He returned holding in his hand a
piece of paper which had once been <span class="fillrect">crimson but which had faded with the passage of time: it was rose colored, tenuous, quadrangular. Ts'ui Pen's calligraphy was justly
famous. </span> Eagerly, but without understanding, I read the words which a man of my
own blood had written with a small brush:<span class="fillrect"> "I leave to various future times, but not to all, my garden of forking paths."</span>
