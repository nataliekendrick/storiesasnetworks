  me, in the last stage of a desperate adventure, on a Western island. </span>I remember the final words, repeated at the end of each version like a secret command:<span class="fillrect"> "Thus the heroes fought, with tranquil heart and bloody sword. They were resigned to killing and to dying."</span>
<br>
<br>
At that moment I felt within me and around me something invisible and intangible
pullulating. <span class="fillrect">It was not the pullulation of two divergent, parallel, and finally converging armies, but an agitation more inaccessible, more intimate, prefigured by them in some way.</span> Stephen Albert continued:
<br>
<br>
"I do not think that your illustrious ancestor toyed idly with variations. I do not find
it believable that he would waste thirteen years laboring over a never ending experiment in rhetoric. <span class="fillrect">In your country the novel is an inferior genre; in Ts'ui Pen's
period, it was a despised one. Ts'ui Pen was a fine novelist but he was also a man of
letters who, doubtless, considered himself more than a mere novelist.</span> The testimony
of his contemporaries attests to this, and certainly the known facts of his life confirm
his leanings toward the metaphysical and the mystical. Philosophical conjectures take
up the greater part of his novel. I know that of all problems, none disquieted him
more, and none concerned him more than the profound one of time. <span class="fillrect">Now then, this is the only problem that does not figure in the pages of The Garden.</span> He does not even use the word which means time. How can these voluntary omissions be
explained?"
<br>
<br>
I proposed various solutions, all of them inadequate. We discussed them. <span class="fillrect">Finally Stephen Albert said: "In a guessing game to which the answer is chess, which word is the only one prohibited?"</span> I thought for a moment and then replied:
<br>
<br>
<span class="fillrect">"The word is chess."</span>
<br>
<br>
"Precisely," said Albert. <span class="fillrect">"The Garden of Forking Paths is an enormous guessing game, or parable, in which the subject is time. The rules of the game forbid the use of the word itself.</span> To eliminate a word completely, to refer to it by means of inept phrases and obvious paraphrases, is perhaps the best way of drawing attention to it. <span class="fillrect">This, then, is the tortuous method of approach preferred by the oblique Ts'ui Pen in every meandering of his interminable novel.</span> I have gone over hundreds of manuscripts, I
have corrected errors introduced by careless copyists, <span class="fillrect">I have worked out the plan from this chaos, I have restored, or believe I have restored, the original. I have
translated the whole work. I can state categorically that not once has the word time
been used in the whole book.</span>

<br>
<br>
"The explanation is obvious. <span class="fillrect">The Garden of Forking Paths is a picture, incomplete yet not false, of the universe such as Ts'ui Pen conceived it to be. Differing from Newton and Schopenhauer, your ancestor did not think of time as absolute and
uniform.</span> He believed in an infinite series of times, in a dizzily growing, ever spreading network of diverging, converging and parallel times. This web of time - the strands of
which approach one another, bifurcate, intersect or ignore each other through the
centuries - embraces every possibility. <span class="fillrect">We do not exist in most of them. In some you exist and not I, while in others I do, and you do not, and in yet others both of us exist.</span> In this one, in which chance has favored me, you have come to my gate. In another, you, <span class="fillrect">crossing the garden, have found me dead. In yet another, I say these very same words, but am an error, a phantom."</span>
